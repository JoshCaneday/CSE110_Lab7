## Check Your Understanding
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

Answer: "Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed" because GitHub Actions are used every time someone pushes so it ensures continuous feedback and development. Additionally, it allows for users to find errors in their code quicker as it runs the test at every push, so it keeps them updated on what is and isn't working. 

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
A: No because end-to-end testing is intended for user interaction rather than checking to make sure a function has the correct output.

3) What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?
A: Navigation mode is a way to simulate the browser session and is best for measuring a user experience while Snapshot mode is more like a static image or representation of the DOM at a specific moment.

4) Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.
A: Optimize images, reduce unused JavaScript and CSS, improve accessibility.
